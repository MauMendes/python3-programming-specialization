# 
#### Open source Software
# Pros: "it lowers consumer cost and increases code flexibility, security, and accountability due to its community source nature,
# and there's good business sense to using open-source software tool"
#
# Apache License: allows linking of Apache lincense code with differently license code. Useful if you want to attach closed-source library 
# or proprietary library in your open source project
#
# GNU Public License or GPL: one can link only other GPL compatible libraries. You may find this license feature desirable if
# your Open Source project is composed of entirely open-source code, and you wish to ensure that this always be the case, regardless of who in the future uses your code. 
# The GPL is probably the most well-known and perhaps common open-source software license, and part due to its viral nature, which requires all link to software to also be 
# GPL licensed. 
#
# 
# We have to install pytesseract
